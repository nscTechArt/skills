# Skills

English | [中文](./README.md)

A fork of [mattpocock/skills](https://github.com/mattpocock/skills): Matt's skills edited to suit the maintainer's workflow, with separately maintained skills alongside them. For personal use only: no releases, no plugin.

## Install

Give the repo URL to an agent and let it install the skills. For example, tell Claude Code:

> Install the skills from https://github.com/nscTechArt/mattpocock-skills into `~/.claude/skills`.

Add these details to make the result predictable:

- **Location**: global by default (`~/.claude/skills` for Claude Code). For other agents, use their matching global directory.
- **Method**: copy by default. After the repo updates, ask the agent to install again.
- **Scope**: all skills, or only the ones you name.

Every directory containing a `SKILL.md` is one skill. `engineering/`, `productivity/` and `non-matt/` are only groupings: drop that level when installing, so each skill sits directly under the install location.

## Layout

- `skills/engineering/`: Matt's skills for code work.
- `skills/productivity/`: Matt's skills for non-code workflow.
- `skills/non-matt/`: personal skills, not from Matt's repo.

The [Reference](#reference) section below lists every skill.

Skills split on one axis: who can invoke them. **User-invoked** skills are reachable only when the user types them (e.g. `/grill-me`); their job is to orchestrate. **Model-invoked** skills can be invoked by the user or reached for automatically by the agent when the task fits; they hold the reusable discipline. A user-invoked skill may invoke model-invoked skills, but never another user-invoked one.

## Reference

### Engineering

Skills for code work.

**User-invoked**

- **[ask-matt](./skills/engineering/ask-matt/SKILL.md)**: Ask which skill or flow fits your situation. A router over the user-invoked skills in this repo.
- **[grill-with-docs](./skills/engineering/grill-with-docs/SKILL.md)**: Grilling session that also builds your project's domain model, sharpening terminology and updating `GLOSSARY.md` and ADRs inline.
- **[triage](./skills/engineering/triage/SKILL.md)**: Move issues through a state machine of triage roles.
- **[improve-codebase-architecture](./skills/engineering/improve-codebase-architecture/SKILL.md)**: Scan a codebase for deepening opportunities, present them as a visual HTML report, then grill through whichever one you pick.
- **[setup-matt-pocock-skills](./skills/engineering/setup-matt-pocock-skills/SKILL.md)**: Configure this repo for the engineering skills (issue tracker, triage labels, domain doc layout). Run once per repo before using the other engineering skills.
- **[to-spec](./skills/engineering/to-spec/SKILL.md)**: Turn the current conversation into a spec and publish it to the issue tracker. No interview, just synthesizes what you've already discussed.
- **[to-tickets](./skills/engineering/to-tickets/SKILL.md)**: Break any plan, spec, or conversation into a set of tracer-bullet tickets, each declaring its blocking edges, written as text in a local file, or as native blocking links on a real tracker.
- **[implement](./skills/engineering/implement/SKILL.md)**: Build the work described by a spec or set of tickets, driving `/tdd` at pre-agreed seams and closing out with `/code-review`.
- **[wayfinder](./skills/engineering/wayfinder/SKILL.md)**: Plan a huge chunk of work, more than one agent session can hold, as a shared map of decision tickets on the issue tracker, and resolve them one at a time until the way to the destination is clear.
- **[retro](./skills/engineering/retro/SKILL.md)**: Suggest improvements to the coding agent's environment (navigation, automated checks, coding standards, steering files, tooling) after a session, most severe first.

**Model-invoked**

- **[prototype](./skills/engineering/prototype/SKILL.md)**: Build a throwaway prototype to answer a design question, either a single shareable HTML file for state/logic questions, or several radically different UI variations toggleable from one route.
- **[diagnosing-bugs](./skills/engineering/diagnosing-bugs/SKILL.md)**: Disciplined diagnosis loop for hard bugs and performance regressions: build a feedback loop that goes red on this bug → minimise → hypothesise → instrument → fix → regression-test.
- **[research](./skills/engineering/research/SKILL.md)**: Investigate a question against high-trust primary sources and capture the findings as a cited Markdown file in the repo, run as a background agent.
- **[tdd](./skills/engineering/tdd/SKILL.md)**: Test-driven development with a red-green-refactor loop. Builds features or fixes bugs one vertical slice at a time.
- **[domain-modeling](./skills/engineering/domain-modeling/SKILL.md)**: Actively build and sharpen a project's domain model: challenge terms against the glossary, stress-test with edge-case scenarios, and update `GLOSSARY.md` and ADRs inline.
- **[codebase-design](./skills/engineering/codebase-design/SKILL.md)**: Shared discipline and vocabulary for designing deep modules: a lot of behaviour behind a small interface, placed at a clean seam, testable through that interface.
- **[code-review](./skills/engineering/code-review/SKILL.md)**: Two-axis review of the diff since a fixed point (at `HEAD`, the uncommitted working tree): **Standards** (does it follow the repo's coding standards, plus a Fowler smell baseline?) and **Spec** (does it faithfully implement the originating issue/spec?), run as parallel sub-agents so neither pollutes the other.

### Productivity

General workflow tools, not code-specific.

**User-invoked**

- **[grill-me](./skills/productivity/grill-me/SKILL.md)**: Get relentlessly interviewed about a plan or design until every branch of the design tree is resolved.
- **[handoff](./skills/productivity/handoff/SKILL.md)**: Compact the current conversation into a handoff document so another agent can continue the work.
- **[teach](./skills/productivity/teach/SKILL.md)**: Teach the user a new skill or concept over multiple sessions, using the current directory as a stateful teaching workspace.
- **[wait-what](./skills/productivity/wait-what/SKILL.md)**: Fire this the moment a message doesn't land. The agent re-pitches it with the context you're missing, in plain English, using your `GLOSSARY.md` vocabulary.

**Model-invoked**

- **[grilling](./skills/productivity/grilling/SKILL.md)**: Interview the user relentlessly about a plan, decision, or idea until every branch of the design tree is resolved. The reusable interview primitive behind `grill-me`, `grill-with-docs`, `triage`, `wayfinder` and `improve-codebase-architecture`.
- **[writing-for-agents](./skills/productivity/writing-for-agents/SKILL.md)**: Writing documents for agents: skills, AGENTS.md/CLAUDE.md, and any doc an agent reaches by a pointer.

### Non-Matt

Personal skills, not from Matt's repo. Upstream sync ignores them.

- **[are-you-sure](./skills/non-matt/are-you-sure/SKILL.md)**: Challenge a proposed software-engineering or technical-project solution before adopting it. User-invoked.
- **[ste](./skills/non-matt/ste/SKILL.md)**: Report results by the ASD-STE100 (Simplified Technical English) principles, in Chinese. Stays active until stopped.
- **[refine](./skills/non-matt/refine/SKILL.md)**: Review a diff, commit, or named area for quality, performance, and reuse, then apply targeted behavior-preserving cleanup.
- **[reclaim-code-entropy](./skills/non-matt/reclaim-code-entropy/SKILL.md)**: Find, rank, and safely remove accidental codebase complexity, with evidence of real consumers before any deletion.

## Upstream

The `upstream` remote points at Matt's repo. Updates are read and absorbed by hand or by a project skill, not merged or cherry-picked. Only `engineering/` and `productivity/` track upstream.
